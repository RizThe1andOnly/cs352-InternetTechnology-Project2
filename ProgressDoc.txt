CS352 Project 2 Progress Document

--- 3/16/2021 ---

    - Created ls.py, ts1.py, and client.py files (they are not fully implemented or implemented at all).

    - ls.py is similar to rs.py from project1 so the contents of rs.py have been copied into it. It will
    need to be updated to meet the requirements for project 2.

    - ts1.py (and ts2.py) should be the same as ts.py from project1 so its contents have been copied. From what
    the instructions say so far there should not be any need to change the ts1.py too much.

    - client.py is similar to client.py from project1 which is why its contents have been copied. This file will
    need to be updated to fit the requirements of projcet2, which I think i have done already but it will have to be checked
    further.

    TODOs (for now that i can think of):
        - Complete the processDNSQuery() method in ls.py, notes on its requirements can be found in the ls.py file.
        NOTE : To complete this method another method (and maybe more) have to be created. See the next item on this
        list.

        - Create methods for creating connection to top levels servers ts1 and ts2 and then requesting DNS entries from
        them. As noted in the notes for processDNSQuery() in ls.py the project's task will require the use of threads, so
        the method defined here will work for both ts1 and ts2. Two threads will be created each calling this method with
        the appropriate parameters to call the separate top level servers. Then the return value of this method should be
        the response from the top level servers if there are any.

        - To accomplish the item above (item 2) we need to look up and learn how to use threads in python. In particular,
        we need to know some key things regarding how to work with them. We need to look up how to send "interrupts". Also,
        we need to learn how to extract return values from methods called by an external thread.

        NOTE : The current methodology of using threads under consideration may not be the one we ultimately end up pursuing.
        For now this is simply a starting point for investigation, after doing some research and more brainstorming we will 
        finalize which method we will pursue.
