CS352 Project 2 Progress Document

--- 3/16/2021 ---

    - Created ls.py, ts1.py, and client.py files (they are not fully implemented or implemented at all).

    - ls.py is similar to rs.py from project1 so the contents of rs.py have been copied into it. It will
    need to be updated to meet the requirements for project 2.

    - ts1.py (and ts2.py) should be the same as ts.py from project1 so its contents have been copied. From what
    the instructions say so far there should not be any need to change the ts1.py too much.

    - client.py is similar to client.py from project1 which is why its contents have been copied. This file will
    need to be updated to fit the requirements of projcet2, which I think i have done already but it will have to be checked
    further.

    TODOs (for now that i can think of):
        - Complete the processDNSQuery() method in ls.py, notes on its requirements can be found in the ls.py file.
        NOTE : To complete this method another method (and maybe more) have to be created. See the next item on this
        list.

        - Create methods for creating connection to top levels servers ts1 and ts2 and then requesting DNS entries from
        them. As noted in the notes for processDNSQuery() in ls.py the project's task will require the use of threads, so
        the method defined here will work for both ts1 and ts2. Two threads will be created each calling this method with
        the appropriate parameters to call the separate top level servers. Then the return value of this method should be
        the response from the top level servers if there are any.

        - To accomplish the item above (item 2) we need to look up and learn how to use threads in python. In particular,
        we need to know some key things regarding how to work with them. We need to look up how to send "interrupts". Also,
        we need to learn how to extract return values from methods called by an external thread.

        NOTE : The current methodology of using threads under consideration may not be the one we ultimately end up pursuing.
        For now this is simply a starting point for investigation, after doing some research and more brainstorming we will 
        finalize which method we will pursue.

    - Created a file called threadingPractice which includes an example of a method to solve the main part of project 2.
    How to have two simultaneous threads running at the same time and get the output from only one of them. Also to shut
    down the threads after 5 seconds.

    TODOs :
        - Actually implement the method in threadingPractice() for project two.
----------------

    - Should've done this earlier but read the instructions more carefully now and looked into non-blocking sockets.
    This seems like a good option to explore so it would be good to check it out as well.

    TODO:
        - Look into and maybe implement non-blocking socket calls for projcet2.
----------------

--- 3/21/2021 to 3/23/2021 ---

    - Implemented non-blocking sockets with the select statement for the project and it seems to work. So far results are
    returnd and judging from the example doc it seems that they are correct. 
    
    - There was an issue with establishing connections with the top level servers from ls.py after the initial initiation.
    The program threw an error upon trying to establish a connection for a second time when a connection already existed.
    This was due to human error. Only one connection should have been maintained at all times rather than tyring to create
    new connections with the same endpoint while one already existed. This issue was resolved by moving the location of the
    connection setup to a point before ls.py began iterations where it would receive a hostname to query and pass it on to the
    top level servers.

    - A new issue that presents itself is regarding the termination of the top level servers after all of the host names that
    have to be queried have been. The processes that the top level servers are being run in are not being terminated after the
    operations are completed. Initailly, the thought process was that when ls.py finished querying all of the hostnames it would
    do a <socket-name>.close() for each of the top level server and that would cause the connections to close with the top level servers.
    Then upon the colsing of the connections the processes themselves would exit due to an exception being raised when the connection
    closed. This does not seems to be the case at the point. Will investigate this further today.

    TODO:
        - Figure out how to close the top level servers after all of the querying is complete.
        - Thoroughly test the code with different inputs to see if everything is functioning as it should.
----------------------------

--- 3/29/2021 ---

    - The code should be complete now, the only thing that remains is thoroughly checking for input cases and then making
    any necessary changes.

    - Fixed the issue of the ts1 and ts2 server not stopping when all of the hostnames have been queried. The solution that
    was implemented for that purpose was to send an additional message to ts1 and ts2 from ls right before ls finished. It
    was a special string "BREAK_STATEMENT" that the two servers would recognize and then stop themselves upon receiving it.
