#note : ts2.py should be the same as t1.py (i think so, so far). the only difference being that it will read from a different input file, PROJ2-DNSTS2.txt.

# changes made include:
# change the toBeReturned in processDNSQuery() to None in the case that the item being queried does not exist in the dns file for this server
# changed the code in server() so no reply sent to if the queried value is not in the dns file for this server aka toBeReturned in processDNSQuery() = None


"""
    Top level server code.

    ------------------

    Will use a dictionary to store the DNS data.
        - The dictionary will be formatted in the following way:
            - key : hostname (the url)
            - value: tuple -> (ip address, A/NS)
    
    ----------------

    The rs code will be organized several methods and the main section that calls the methods. The methods are:
        - getDNSEntries
        - processDNSQuery (check if hostname exists in the server dictionary)
        - server
